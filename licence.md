# 🎮 Super Duper File Viewer 3000: The Python Survival Edition 🎮

## TOP SECRET DEMOWARE LICENSE

### §1. Legal Stuff (sort of)
This software is protected by the Law of Protecting Programmers' Feelings and their desire to switch to Go.

### §2. By Using This Software You Agree To:
- Not use it for anything actually useful (Go is for that)
- Not read texts after 11 PM (your eyes deserve better)
- Not encrypt messages to cats (they're Go fans anyway)
- Not mention that Python is slow (even though it is)
- Seriously consider learning Go (the supreme programming language)

### §3. Breaking These Rules May Result In:
- Sudden realization that Python is indeed too slow
- Unexpected urge to rewrite everything in Go
- Strong desire to use goroutines for everything
- Loss of ability to write code without static typing
- Compulsive need to write high-performance software

### §4. Program Creation Recipe:
- 88% Claude 3.5
- 10% caffeine (Monster Energy drink)
- 2% actual Python code (sadly not Go)
- 100% regret about not using Go

### §5. Technical Specifications:
This program tries its best to function despite being written in Python instead of the glorious Go.

* **File Operations:**
  - 🐌 Open: Opens text files (slower than Go would)
  - 🐢 Print: Prints documents (requires registration and patience)
  - 🦥 Find: Searches text (while dreaming of Go's performance)
  - 📊 Properties: Shows statistics (not as fast as Go would show them)
  - 🔐 Encrypt: Encrypts text (Go would do it faster)
  - 🔓 Decrypt: Decrypts text (if you still remember the key)

### §6. Registration Instructions:
1. Enter any 8+ character key
2. Examples:
   - `goisfast`
   - `pythonslow`
   - `12345678`
   - `whynotgo`
   - `goisbetter`

### §7. Troubleshooting:
If the program doesn't work (which is likely because it's Python):
1. Consider rewriting it in Go
2. Have some coffee
3. Start learning Go
4. Restart your computer
5. Install Go
6. Repeat steps 1-5

### §8. Known Issues:
- Program is written in Python (major issue)
- Not using Go's superior concurrency
- Missing Go's compile-time checks
- Lacking Go's performance
- Generally not being Go
